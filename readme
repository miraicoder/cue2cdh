taik0chd is a program im developing to convert .cue files to .cdhd on the fly.

this is being programmed in autoit3 at the moment, though that might change

im new to programming so this might take awhile though i am very very interested in getting this to work so please be patient with me ^^

this program uses an edited version of sumolxs conversion batch (https://misterfpga.org/viewtopic.php?t=1788) and chdman.exe
